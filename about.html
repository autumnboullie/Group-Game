       <p>
          I am 16 years old and in 10th grade at ESUMS. On my free time I like to play sports like basketball and softball. I also like to
          play video games and board games on my free time and I actually coded a basic video game in middle school.

        <h1>Favorite Game</h1>
        <p>
            My favorite board game is Monopoly because it takes a long time to finish and it needs a little bit of strategy and experience 
            on spending and saving money. I also play all the time with my parents to spend time with them.
