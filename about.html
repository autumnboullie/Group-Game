     <h1>Autumn Boullie</h1>
       <p>
          I am 16 years old and in 10th grade at ESUMS. On my free time I like to play sports like basketball and softball. I also like to
          play video games and board games on my free time and I actually coded a basic video game in middle school.
        </p>

        <h1>Favorite Game</h1>
        <p>
            My favorite board game is Monopoly because it takes a long time to finish and it needs a little bit of strategy and experience 
            on spending and saving money. I also play all the time with my parents to spend time with them.

          <p>
              I am a 16 year old sophmore that goes to Engineering and Science university magnet school. I've been playing all types
              of video games my entire life. This is my first time developing a game with anything other than scratch.
           </p> 
           
<h1>Game Definition</h1>
        <p>
            A game is an interactive piece of code that consist of a purpose, a goal, and a character or object that is controlled or 
            that is interacted with.
        </p>

<h1> Favorite Game </h1>
    <p>
        My favorite game right now is NBA2k23. This is my favortite game because most of my friends are playing this game right now, 
        and basketball is one of my favorite things to play. The game has mechanics that make it different from playing basketball in
        real life, but it still feels like actual basketball, which is what makes it fun.

<h1> Gamer Types </h1>
    <p>
I'm 73% Killer. Killers get their kicks from imposing themselves on others. This may be "nice", ie. busybody do-gooding, but few people 
practice such an approach because the rewards (a warm, cosy inner glow, apparently) aren't very substantial. Much more commonly, people 
attack other players with a view to killing off their personae (hence the name for this style of play). The more massive the distress caused, 
the greater the killer's joy at having caused it. Normal points-scoring is usually required so as to become powerful enough to begin causing 
havoc in earnest, and exploration of a kind is necessary to discover new and ingenious ways to kill people. Even socialising is sometimes 
worthwhile beyond taunting a recent victim, for example in finding out someone's playing habits, or discussing tactics with fellow killers. 
They're all just means to an end, though; only in the knowledge that a real person, somewhere, is very upset by what you've just done, yet can 
themselves do nothing about it, is there any true adrenalin-shooting, juicy fun.
